# DOML-VIM
A vim plugin for DOML granting various benefits so far just syntax highlighting and indentation and later could include more like autocompletion.

## Help Wanted
If you understand VimScript more than me (I'm simply a beginner at all things Vim, though I'm quite happy with how this turned out) and would like to improve the features such as auto indenting on '=' (to align just like what the example has done) that would be well appreciated.  Just open a pull request with the requested changes (done through a fork) and after checking them they will be merged if they improve it :).
